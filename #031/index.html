                <h2>Poem of a lovesick</h2>
                <p>
                    There is a place out there where oceans flow upwards and the sun is not hot. <br>
                    It is a place where all my thoughts reside, and only my imagination can dictate what is not. <br>
                    I actually do not know what I'm saying. I don't think it even make any sense. <br>
                    Maybe it's just that the look of your stunning eyes makes me this tense.
